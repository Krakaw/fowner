> The aptly named F-Owner is a dynamic system to track who owns a feature and when any files within that feature set are changed.
> It does this by extracting author information from the git repository and allowing features to be set via commit messages.

## Examples

### Adding features

> Features can be added via appending `[Feature 1,Feature 2]` to pull request titles.
> 
> Or features can be added via generating a dotfile and manually adding a features to a file as a comma separated list.

### Adding Owners

> `Owners` are extracted via the import process and automatically stored against files.
> 
> Each `Owner` can have a `primary_owner_id` this solves for where Github handles have been confused so that a single owner can be presented in the results.
